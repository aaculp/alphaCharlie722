# Community Guidelines

## Our Mission

OTW is built on trust, authenticity, and respect. These guidelines help maintain a positive community where everyone can share honest experiences and discover great venues.

## Core Values

### 🤝 Respect

Treat others as you'd like to be treated. We're all here to share experiences and help each other discover great places.

### ✨ Authenticity

Share genuine experiences. Honest feedback helps everyone make better decisions.

### 💬 Constructive Communication

Provide helpful feedback that benefits both venues and other users.

### 🛡️ Safety

Protect your privacy and the privacy of others. Keep our community safe for everyone.

Instead of: "It was good"
Try: "The espresso was perfectly balanced, and the barista was knowledgeable about their beans"

#### Be Honest

Share your genuine experience, both positive and negative aspects.

Consider the full context of your visit. One bad experience doesn't define a venue.
