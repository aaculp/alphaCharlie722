## Rating Guidelines

### Star Ratings

- ⭐ **1 Star**: Poor experience, significant issues
- ⭐⭐ **2 Stars**: Below expectations, multiple problems
- ⭐⭐⭐ **3 Stars**: Average, met basic expectations
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ **4 Stars**: Good experience, exceeded expectations
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **5 Stars**: Excellent, highly recommend

### What to Consider

When rating a venue, think about:

- **Service**: Was the staff friendly and helpful?
- **Atmosphere**: Did you enjoy the vibe and ambiance?
- **Quality**: Were the products/services high quality?
- **Value**: Was it worth the price?
- **Cleanliness**: Was the venue well-maintained?
- **Overall Experience**: Would you return?

## Writing Helpful Reviews

### Do's ✅

- **Be specific**: Mention what you liked or didn't like
- **Be honest**: Share your genuine experience
- **Be constructive**: Offer helpful feedback
- **Be fair**: Consider the full experience
- **Be timely**: Review soon after your visit

**Good Example:**
> "Great coffee and cozy atmosphere! The barista recommended the cold brew which was excellent. Only downside was limited seating during peak hours. Would definitely return for a quieter afternoon visit."

### Don'ts ❌

- **Don't be vague**: "It was okay" doesn't help others
- **Don't be offensive**: Keep it respectful
- **Don't spam**: One review per venue
- **Don't be irrelevant**: Stay on topic
- **Don't share personal info**: Protect your privacy

**Bad Example:**
> "Terrible place. Worst ever. Never going back."
